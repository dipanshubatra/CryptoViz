### Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  actor User as User Interface
  participant Store as Zustand Store
  participant Hook as useCipherWorker()
  participant Worker as Web Worker
  participant Cipher as Cipher Module
  participant Animator as Animator Store

  User->>Store: Input text, select Key, & options
  Store->>Hook: Trigger runCipher()
  Hook->>Worker: postMessage(WorkerRequest + unique ID)
  activate Worker
  Worker->>Cipher: Call encrypt() / decrypt()
  Note over Cipher: Execute instrumented<br/>vs fast execution path
  Cipher-->>Worker: Return CipherResult + steps[]
  Worker-->>Hook: postMessage(WorkerResponse)
  deactivate Worker
  Hook->>Animator: Load steps[] and output
  Animator->>User: Render output & step-by-step state
```

1. **User input**: The user types plaintext, configures keys, and options in the visualizer UI.
2. **State dispatch**: React fields update state in the visualizer Zustand store.
3. **Worker handoff**: The `useCipherWorker()` hook captures input and creates a `WorkerRequest` payload with a unique ID, sending it via `postMessage()`.
4. **Execution**: The Web Worker (`cipher.worker.ts`) acts as a router, calling the selected cipher's `encrypt` or `decrypt` module function.
5. **Path selection**: If the UI is open, the instrumented path runs to produce `steps[]` trace data; otherwise, a fast path executes.
6. **Worker response**: The worker returns the `WorkerResponse` with the `CipherResult` object (containing `output` and `steps[]`).
7. **Animation trigger**: The hook resolves the promise, updates the Zustand state, and populates the `StepAnimator` UI component for display.

### Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale | Trade-off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deployment Model** | Next.js Static Export (`output: 'export'`) | High scalability, zero hosting costs, and server-side safety under Vercel Free Tier. | No runtime Node.js middleware; requires static pre-generation. |
| **Cryptography Threading** | Browser Web Workers | Offloads math operations from the UI thread to prevent browser interface freeze. | Message serialization latency between main thread and worker. |
| **Cryptographic Primitives** | `@noble/*` Libraries | Audited, secure, dependency-free, and tree-shakeable alternative to legacy modules. | Minimal feature footprint; requires custom implementation of block modes. |
| **Static Site Search** | Pagefind WASM | Compiles a static search index at build time, executing search directly in WASM. | Requires a local build hook step to generate indexes. |
| **State Management** | Zustand | Lightweight state store with URL hash synchronization. | Manual sync needed to prevent SSR mismatches. |
| **Testing Harness** | Vitest | Extremely fast, ESM-native test runner sharing Next.js configurations. | Simulates DOM APIs via jsdom. |
| **Component System** | Radix UI Primitive wrapper | Unstyled accessible base primitives designed to be styled using Tailwind. | Requires writing custom Tailwind wrappers for each component. |

### SaaS Architecture (Additive Layer)
The SaaS layer (Phase 9) integrates seamlessly as an additive option without altering the static visualizer core:
- **Auth**: Executed on Vercel Serverless Functions utilizing `better-auth` supporting OAuth and password flows.
- **Database**: `Neon` Serverless PostgreSQL managed via `Drizzle ORM`.
- **Payments**: `Stripe Checkout` redirects and customer portal webhook synchronizations.
- **Messaging**: `Resend` APIs for transaction alerts and user confirmations.
- **Rate Limiting**: `Upstash Redis` token-bucket rate limits on edge functions.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up or developing CryptoViz, try the solutions below before opening an issue.

### 1. `npm install` fails

**Problem**

Dependencies fail to install or installation stops with errors.

**Solution**

- Ensure you are using **Node.js 22.x LTS** and **npm 10.x+**.
- Remove the existing dependencies and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item package-lock.json
npm install
```

---

### 2. `npm run build` fails

**Problem**

The production build exits with compilation or type errors.

**Solution**

- Verify all dependencies are installed.
- Fix any TypeScript or ESLint errors shown in the terminal.
- Run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

again after resolving the reported issues.

---

### 3. Development server does not start

**Problem**

Running `npm run dev` does not launch the local development server.

**Solution**

- Confirm that dependencies are installed.
- Check whether port **3000** is already in use.
- Restart the terminal and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### 4. Missing `.env.local` configuration

**Problem**

The application cannot access required environment variables.

**Solution**

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the required variables, for example:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Restart the development server after saving the file.

---

### 5. Node.js version mismatch

**Problem**

Commands fail because an unsupported Node.js version is installed.

**Solution**

Check your installed version:

```bash
node -v
```

If needed, upgrade to **Node.js 22.x LTS**, then reinstall dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### General Debugging Tips

- Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch before starting work.
- Run `npm install` after updating dependencies.
- Restart the development server after modifying environment variables.
- Read terminal error messages carefully to identify the root cause.
- Run `npm run lint` before creating a pull request.

## 🤝Contributing

We welcome contributions to CryptoViz. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [GUIDELINES.md](./GUIDELINES.md) to understand local development protocols, code structure, and pull request rules.

- **To add a new cipher**: Create a pure mathematical module, add tests, and update the Web Worker router.
- **To add a new doc**: Add a `.mdx` file to the content path with the required Zod frontmatter fields.
- **To add a resource**: Update the static resource array database with verified HTTPS URLs.

### Constants Naming Convention

CryptoViz enforces a lint-friendly, centralized naming convention for application constants:

- **Central Module**: All shared constants (storage keys, collection limits, event names, performance thresholds, and schema versions) are defined in [`constants/index.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Rushabh%20Mahajan/Documents/GitHub/CryptoViz/constants/index.ts) and exported via `@/constants`.
- **`CRYPTOVIZ_` Prefix**: All global constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE prefixed with **`CRYPTOVIZ_`** (e.g., `CRYPTOVIZ_BENCHMARK_HISTORY_KEY`, `CRYPTOVIZ_MAX_FAVORITE_CIPHERS`, `CRYPTOVIZ_SPEEDUP_THRESHOLD`).
- **No Hard-coded Strings**: Modules across the codebase import constants directly from `@/constants` to ensure maintainability, avoid magic strings, and satisfy linter rules.
